To Do
---

- [ ] mirror Y
- [ ] allow panning the grid (a "hand" tool)
- [ ] shortcuts (copy from aseprite)
- [ ] bulk downloads (i.e., download the sprites as a spritesheet)
- [ ] load masks
- [ ] export/download options (i.e., download at 10x, 1x)
- [ ] when mirroring, show the mirrored cells
- [ ] dedupe previews
- [ ] use more colors on the same sprite
- [ ] introduce light/shadow tool (computes automatically shades for current pixel)
